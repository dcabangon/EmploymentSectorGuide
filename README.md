# EmploymentSector Site

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Due to the collapse of the economy brought upon by the pandemic, initial data gathered shows lack of workforce in various sectors. Thus, rebuilding and strengthening employment is paramount, and is now needed more than ever. 

The Employment Sector project aims to provide in-depth information about the employment count of Singapore. It can cater to the government as well as the job hunters. It would be beneficial for the government as its main goal is to organize the updated data to aid manpower allocation. Moreover, the job hunters could take advantage of this, as the application has its potential to be a job portal in the future. 

Given that data organization is its backbone, it would provide the user a systematized flow of information. Hence, giving them an opportunity to make better decisions for future endeavors.

### FEATURES

 The sitesâ€™ main feature is the interactive charts where the user can see the different numeric data of the different sectors featured.
 The side by side charts also feature its synchronous nature where in the event of a hover action, the indicator from where you are pointing the cursor, the partner chart will follow its location.
 Additionally, It also features a drop down where you can select different time frames and project data from the selected one.

 With regards to pending implementation, the site has potential to be a job portal, with this site being the intro page for it. User can be educated to the current status of the employment industries and will be able to help them make a more informed decisions regarding their carreer path or future choices

 For the bugs and limitations, I find that I always need to refresh the page to get it to work properly, resizing the window from a larger size to a smaller one, and vice versa.
